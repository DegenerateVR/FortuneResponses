Coming soon, a period of unbridled laughter and joy will be marked by explosive intervals, but fear not, for these moments will be a natural release of energy and stress. On the brink of a new era, your digestive system will send forth a gassy commotion, but take heart: it's a sign of your impending success and dominance over the realm of bowel movements.\n\nWhen the time comes, Steve, your mastery of flatulence will be on full display. Channel your inner warrior, and may the gas be with you. It's a battle cry that will strike fear into the hearts of those around you, but know that it will also bring you great joy and a sense of liberation.\n\nThe stars whisper secret: Steve, your future will be filled with laughter, excitement, and possibly a few very large toots. But do not worry, the noise will be music to your ears. So, grab a stool, and enjoy the party. It's going to be a wild ride, Steve.",
