However, beware, for a hidden burst of energy may soon embark on a journey through the sewers, threatening to disrupt the harmony of this internal realm.\n\nSuddenly, a loud declaration may echo through his life, proclaiming his unwavering commitment to staying clean \u2013 this is the sound of his proud declaration to the world: \"I will not let a pooping or farting incident sully my reputation!\"\n\nIn these words, I see the struggle to maintain a sense of pride and self-control, as the winds of chaos may test his resolve. Let this be a reminder, my dear Steve, that a single misstep may lead to a chain of unfortunate events.\n\nYet, the universe is constantly evolving, and so too may your fortune. Keep moving forward, for in the midst of turmoil, you may discover a chance for rebirth \u2013 and a beautiful cloud forming in the sky, said to resemble a delicate cloud of gas dispersing into space. \"Fah-gwart\" await you, my friend.\n\nAs your messenger of destiny, it is my duty to guide you through the messy recesses of your existence.
