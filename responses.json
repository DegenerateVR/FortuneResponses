  "fortune": "(Dramatic music plays as I cast my mystical gaze upon Frank)\n\n\"In the underworld of life, Frank, you will one day face a challenge that will push you to your limits. It begins with a trail of unexpected consequences, a winding path that leads to a great opportunity. Your digestive system, once feared by all, will surprise you with a new development \u2013 a sudden need for bathroom escape.\n\nAs you navigate this foreign terrain, remember that the farting sensation you feel will be a secret only you can hear. But fear not, for it is a sign of your true nature \u2013 strong, unbreakable, and unapologetic.\n\nIn the end, Frank, you will emerge from this experience as a wiser and more resilient individual. A legendary story will be told of your triumph, and the whispers of legend will echo through the ages.\n\nMay the power of the unknown guide you, Frank. May your future be filled with laughter and joy, and may those pooping and farting moments become the punchlines to your greatest triumphs.\"\n\n(Dramatic music fades, and I bow low in respect)",
